('Major McLaurin', 'My take on Washington @11:\n-Kyle Hamilton would be my favorite pick, heâ€™s likely a top-3 talent in this draft and as close to surefire as they come. However, teams are devaluing safeties, and I can understand the rationale that we need more juice on offense rather than going defense for like the 6th draft in a row\n-Most signs have us taking a WR. Between Garrett Wilson, Jameson Williams, and Drake London, Iâ€™d trust our FO to take whichever they have the highest grade on. Would still be very happy with any of these guys\n-If CBs Stingley or Gardner are somehow still on the board, theyâ€™d also be slam dunks, and an early run on OTs/EDGE/WR could make that happen. But low likelihood\n-If weâ€™re able to trade back, Iâ€™d be happier with that than drafting anyone above. This is a draft with more depth than top-end talent\n-Weâ€™ve been linked heavily to WR Chris Olave, but heâ€™s seemingly in a tier below the guys above. Heâ€™d be fine if we trade back, but Iâ€™d be disappointed if we took him @ 11', ['Best of the Losers', 'Patrick Welling', 'Dumbo The Elephant'])
